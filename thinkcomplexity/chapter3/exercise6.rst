Chapter 3 Exercise 6
====================
Test the performance of LinearMap, BetterMap and HashMap; see if you can
characterize their order of growth.

You can download my map implementations from thinkcomplex.com/Map.py, and the
code I used in this section from thinkcomplex.com/listsum.py.

You will have to find a range of n that is big enough to show asymptotic
behavior, but small enough to run quickly.
