Chapter 4 Exercise 3
====================
Read the Watts and Strogatz paper and answer the following questions:

http://www.kjhole.com/PDF/Watts-Strogatz.pdf


What process do Watts and Strogatz use to rewire their graphs?
--------------------------------------------------------------

Pick a vertex(v) and edge(e) to nearest clockwise neighbor(w).
With probability p reconnect e with new w chosen uniformly from all vertices.
Duplicate edges forbidden.
Continue clockwise (to w) for one lap.
Then repeat with with next nearest clockwise neighbor until all edges have
been considered once.


What is the definition of the clustering coefficient C(p)?
----------------------------------------------------------

The fraction of all possible edges for a vertex, averaged over all vertices


What is the definition of the average path length L(p)?
-------------------------------------------------------

The shortest path between two vertices, averaged over all pairs of vertices.


What real-world graphs did Watts and Strogatz look at?
-------------------------------------------------------
Actors working together in movies, powergrid, neural network of a worm.


What evidence do they present that these graphs have the same structure as the
graphs generated by their model?

The built random graphs with same number of vertices and average number of
edges per vertex. Showing similar L(p) but not similar C(p) between real-world
and random graphs.
