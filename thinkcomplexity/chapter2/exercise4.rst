Chapter 2 Exercise 4
====================

Create a file named RandomGraph.py and define a class named RandomGraph that
inherits from Graph and provides a method named add_random_edges that takes
a probability p as a parameter and, starting with an edgeless graph, adds
edges at random so that the probability is p that there is an edge between any
two nodes.
