Exercise 1
============

Read the Wikipedia page about graphs at
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(mathematics) and answer the following
questions:


What is a simple graph?
-----------------------

A (strict) Set of vertices and (strict) Set undirected edges (pairs of
vertices). An undirected graph with no loops (edges with same vertex on both
ends) and no multiple edges (no pair of vertices has more than one edge between
them).


What is a regular graph?
------------------------

Graph in which each vertex has the same number of neighbor vertices (same degree).


What is a complete graph?
-------------------------

Graph in which each vertex is connected to every other vertex by one and only one edge.


Prove that a complete graph is regular.
---------------------------------------

Don't do proofs. It's obvious, if every vertex is connected to n-1 vertices then they all have degree n-1.


What is a path?
----------------

A pair of vertices x,y such y may be reached from x by following edges to
connected intervening vertices. It may be directed on undirected


What is a cycle?
----------------

A path that loops back onto itself such that it has no beginning or end.


What is a forest?
-----------------

One or more trees.


What is a tree?
---------------

A connected (there is path between every pair of vertices) graph with no cycles.
