Exercise 6
==========

One of the properties that displays this kind of transition is connectedness.
For a given size n, there is a critical value, p*, such that a random graph
G(n, p) is unlikely to be connected if p < p* and very likely to be connected
if p > p*.

Write a program that tests this result by generating random graphs for values
of n and p and computes the fraction of them that are connected.

You can download my solution from thinkcomplex.com/RandomGraph.py.

How does the abruptness of the transition depend on n?
------------------------------------------------------
The transition occurs at lower p's for larger n's.
The sharpness increases for larger n's.
