thinkcomplexity
===============

Exercises and explorations from the book Think Complexity http://www.greenteapress.com/compmod/

Goals
-----
  #. Explore tox usage.
  #. Python 2.7, 3.4, 3.5 compatibility.
  #. Clean Architecture (I suspect the exercise structure will prevent this).


Thoughts
--------

Chapter 2
=========
Kind of crappy Graph classes...

Exercise 3, add_regular_edges: First exercise that required some thought.
